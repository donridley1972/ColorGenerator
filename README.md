# Color Generator

This application allows you to select colors, either through the built in color picker, or by using the eye dropper to select a color anywhere on the screen(s).  A color palette is then generated based upon the selected color and color strategy.

The color palette can be printed or saved as a PDF.

A code signed installer is provided.

Enjoy!
